## Kiro Acceleration Points
This project demonstrates how Kiro accelerated development through:
1. Rapid project scaffolding and structure setup
2. Component architecture planning and implementation
3. Styling system creation with consistent design tokens
4. Integration of third-party libraries (charts, icons)
5. Responsive design implementation
6. Code organization and best practices enforcement
